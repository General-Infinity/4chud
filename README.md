# making flags work
in order to make the flags work you will need to get geoip2.phar from [here](https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-php/releases/tag/v2.11.0) and put it in the lib/ folder

you will also need to get GeoLite2-Country.mmdb from [the geolite2 website](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) and put that in the lib/ folder too
